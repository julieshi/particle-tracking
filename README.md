MATLAB scripts for multiple-particle tracking

What these files can be used for:
- Simulating the brownian motion of 40 nm polystyrene beads in a glycerol solution
- Calculating average velocity and diffusivity coefficients from mean-squared-displacement (MSD) plots
- Calculating Relative Change (RC) values from MSD plots

The original experimental data was obtained using Volocity, v.6 (Perkin Elmer).

Please refer to this paper for further background on the files:
